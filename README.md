This project features a robust data warehousing model tailored for disease-related data. Leveraging PostgreSQL for the coding aspects and harnessing the analytical prowess of PowerBI for business intelligence insights, this endeavor culminates in a comprehensive solution.

Central to the project's functionality is the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. By seamlessly orchestrating the transfer of data from the OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) environment to the Data Warehouse, this crucial step ensures that information is not only aggregated but also optimized for analytical queries.

Through meticulous ETL procedures, raw data undergoes a transformation journey, where it is cleansed, standardized, and harmonized to align with the schema of the data warehouse. This meticulous process guarantees data integrity and consistency, laying a solid foundation for robust analytics and reporting capabilities.

In essence, the ETL framework serves as the backbone of this project, facilitating the seamless flow of data from its operational origins to a centralized repository optimized for insightful analysis and informed decision-making.
