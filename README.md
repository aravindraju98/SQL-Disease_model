Disease Data Warehousing: PostgreSQL ETL & PowerBI BI Integration


Welcome to our Disease Data Warehousing project! This repository houses a comprehensive solution for managing and analyzing disease-related data. We leverage PostgreSQL for efficient coding and PowerBI for dynamic Business Intelligence insights.
Key Features:

    ETL Excellence: Our project excels in Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, seamlessly transferring data from Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) systems to our Data Warehouse. Through meticulous transformation procedures, raw data is cleansed, standardized, and harmonized, ensuring integrity and consistency.

    PostgreSQL Prowess: With PostgreSQL at the helm, our coding endeavors are optimized for efficiency and scalability. From data manipulation to schema management, PostgreSQL empowers our backend operations with reliability and performance.

    PowerBI Integration: Harnessing the analytical prowess of PowerBI, our Business Intelligence (BI) capabilities reach new heights. Visualize, analyze, and gain insights from our enriched data warehouse effortlessly, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.
